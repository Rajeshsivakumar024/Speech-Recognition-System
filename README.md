# Task 4: Speech Recognition System

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple speech recognition system using a microcontroller and embedded C programming. It detects specific pre-defined voice commands and performs corresponding actions, such as turning devices ON or OFF. This is the 4th task of my Embedded Systems Internship with Elite Tech Intern.

## Components Used
- PIC16F877A Microcontroller
- Voice Recognition Module (e.g., V3)
- Relay Module or LED (for output indication)
- Power Supply
- MPLAB X IDE

## How It Works
- The voice recognition module is trained with specific voice commands like “ON” or “OFF”
- It sends a digital signal to the microcontroller based on the recognized command
- The microcontroller processes the signal and controls an output device like an LED or relay
